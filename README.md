Our web site is located at **<http://xen-master.org>**. Somebody already snatched xenmaster.org, unfortunately.
Frontend development takes place on the [XenMaster-WebUI repo](https://github.com/NoSTaBoNN/XenMaster-WebUI).

**Short motivational speech**: Xen needs a proper web based GUI. We're making it happen.

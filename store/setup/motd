Hi, and welcome to your freshly installed Debian-based Xen host with XAPI.

Thank you for using our splendid network installer to install your system.
However, there are some things that deserve your immediate attention, outlined at https://github.com/Double-U/XenMaster/wiki/After-Setup .
When you think this message is no longer necessary and frankly disturbing your inner peace, execute /root/setup-done.sh and this message will vanish.

Enjoy your coffee,
The XenMaster team
